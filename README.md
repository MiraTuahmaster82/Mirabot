Mirabot is a Discord bot built with the discord.py library. It uses slash commands to provide various features, including:

Sending random images of cats, bunnies, and dogs.
Responding with latency ("ping").
Sending specific media links ("skibidi", "motho_special", "me_when").
Generating a random number.
Searching Wikipedia and Urban Dictionary for a term, returning results as embeds.
The bot loads its token from environment variables, registers commands on startup, and prints status messages to the console.
